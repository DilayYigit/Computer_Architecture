This respiratory contains the homeworks and the solutions of the CS 202 (Fundamental Structures of Computer Science 2) course I took at Bilkent University. This course introduces MIPS instruction set and registers, branching and procedure calls, addressing modes, single cycle processor datapath, single cycle control, multicycle processor datapath, multicycle control, exceptions, interrupts, pipelining hazards and stalls, superscalar processor, out of order execution, Register renaming, IA-32 architecture, memory system performance and hierarchy, caches, memory system optimization, virtual memory, memory mapped I/O.
* Lab01: Creating and Running Simple MIPS Assembly Language Programs
